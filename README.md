Uploaded to GitHub so that I can recover the project if I accidentally delete it on my computer.

The app, so far, only has one working function (and tested) that randomly generates a password and returns a String variable. The get() function in the Metadata should work too, but it uses the linear search algorithm. I will eventually implement the B-Tree algorithm for faster queries.
